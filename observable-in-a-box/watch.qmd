When setting up Observable to work with other systems (in particular with FFIs),
it's useful to "watch" a reactive value. Observable-in-a-box just gives you
a `watch` method:

```{observable}
x = ~~(now / 1000)
```

To be notified when the values of `x` change, call `watch` and give it a callback:

```js
window._ojs.obsInABox.watch("x", (v, name) => console.log(`${name}'s value is now ${v}`));
```

TODO: Debounce `watch`.

TODO: `unwatch`.
