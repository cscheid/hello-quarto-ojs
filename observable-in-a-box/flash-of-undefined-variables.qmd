title: "Flash of Undefined Variables"
format: html
---

Currently, we can sometimes show a brief flash of "undefined"
variables during initialization.  That's not ideal.

**2021-06-24 1:16PM MST**: I could swear I saw this happening before, but
I can't reproduce it now. I tried multiple separate cells as well as a
single one. Maybe it's specific to the way we do IPC?

```{observable}
x = y * z
y = w * 30
z = now % 1000
w = {
  await Promises.tick(5000);
  return 0.5;
}
```
