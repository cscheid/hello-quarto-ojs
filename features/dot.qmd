You can use Observable's `dot` template literal:

```{ojs}
dot`digraph { a -> b; }`
```

It's also possible to use a slightly terser syntax with the `dot` chunk language:

```{dot}
digraph { a -> b; }
```

Testing yaml-style metadata inside `dot` chunks:

```{dot}
//| echo: false
digraph { 
  no -> source; 
  source -> here; 
}
```
