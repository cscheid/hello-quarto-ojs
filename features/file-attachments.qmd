title: "File Attachments"
---

File attachments work similarly to how they do in Observable. You include them as
a resource in your quarto document or project, and then access them
with `FileAttachment`. Here we're using Allison Horst's excellent
[palmer penguins dataset](penguins.csv)
([source](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)).

Quarto tries to figure out which files you want to use as attachments
by inspecting the source code for `FileAttachment(...)` literals. If
you have arbitrary logic to decide on the filename to load, you will
need to explicitly add those files as resources in your project's
YAML frontmatter (or in some of its pages).

```{ojs}
data = FileAttachment("penguins.csv").csv()
```

```{ojs}
avg = {
  let vs = data.map(s => s.bill_length_mm).filter(s => s !== "NA").map(Number);
  let n = 0;
  vs.forEach(v => n += v);
  return n / vs.length;
}
```
