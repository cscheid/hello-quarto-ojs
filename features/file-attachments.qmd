File attachments work like they do in Observable. You include them as
a resource in your quarto document or project, and then access them
with `FileAttachment`. Here we're using Allison Horst's excellent
[palmer penguins dataset](penguins.csv)
([source](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)).


```{observable}
data = FileAttachment("penguins.csv").csv()
```

```{observable}
avg = {
  let vs = data.map(s => s.bill_length_mm).filter(s => s !== "NA").map(Number);
  let n = 0;
  vs.forEach(v => n += v);
  return n / vs.length;
}
```
