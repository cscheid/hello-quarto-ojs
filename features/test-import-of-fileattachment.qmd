title: "Test import of fileattachment"
format: html
---

The `out` symbol from the imported notebook uses a remotely-resolved
`FileAttachment`. This notebook tests whether our override of
`FileAttachment` inside Quarto breaks the `FileAttachment` calls of
imported modules. It doesn't appear to:

```{ojs}
import { out } from "@cscheid/testing-module-level-fileattachments-being-exported"
out / 5
```

On the _other_ hand, this notebook actually triggered the "flash of
unevaluated observable" bug we were hoping to see earlier. This is now fixed.
