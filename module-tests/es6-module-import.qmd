title: "ES6 Module Imports"
resources:
  - test.js
  - ../lib/module-1.js
---

In addition to regular imports from observablehq notebooks, we also
support ES6 module imports from local files. In this basic case, we
have a [very simple test file](test.js):

```{observable}
import { test } from "./test.js";
test()
```

We also support root-relative imports. In this case, our runtime
converts the import into a relative import with the right offset, so
your project can be deployed deep into a web server file hierarchy:

```{observable}
import { f1 } from "/lib/module-1.js";
f1()
```

## Known issues

Currently, javascript module files have to be declared as resources in
the YAML frontmatter.
