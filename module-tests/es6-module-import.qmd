title: "ES6 Module Imports"
---

In addition to regular imports from observablehq notebooks, Quarto OJS also
supports ES6 module imports from local files. In this basic case, we
have a [very simple test file](test.js):

```{ojs}
import { test } from "./test.js";
test()
```

Quarto notices the `./test.js` being imported and automatically
includes it as a resource to be added to the project build.
