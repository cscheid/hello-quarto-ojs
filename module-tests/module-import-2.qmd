title: "ES6 Recursive Imports"
---

We also support ES6 recursive imports, and Quarto traverses the ES6 modules
recursively to include them as resources in your project.

```{observable}
// test-2.js itself imports a bar.js ES6 module.
import { v1, v2 } from "./test-2.js";
```

```{observable}
v1()
v2()
```
